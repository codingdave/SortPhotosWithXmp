// Serilog.Events.LogEventLevel
// Verbose: Anything and everything you might want to know about a running block of code.
// Debug: Internal system events that aren't necessarily observable from the outside.
// Information: The lifeblood of operational intelligence - things happen.
// Warning: Service is degraded or endangered.
// Error:Functionality is unavailable, invariants are broken or data is lost.
// Fatal: If you have a pager, it goes off when one of these occurs.
// ---
//Trace:
// contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive
// application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be
// enabled in a production environment.
// Debug:
// used for interactive investigation during development. These logs
// should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term
// value.
// Information:
// track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value.
// Warning:
// Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow,
// but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop.
// Error:
// Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure.
// These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide
// failure.
// Critical:
// Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic
// failure that requires immediate attention.
// None:
// Not used for writing log messages. Specifies that a logging category should not
// write any messages.
